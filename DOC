Adjustable parameters:

Realtime:
- RSR_TOP
- MAX_LATENCY_DROP
- TRAIN_PKTS
- dropping time
- AGAG period
- SEND_Q_LIMIT_MINIMAL 9000
- SENQ_Q_LIMIT_THRESHOLD 13000
- rtt2 smoothing
(- sum length)
(- code %) - only in AG mode!

Semi-static:
- Cubic B
- Cubic C
- reordering (latency, packets)
- Network timeout time

Static:
- WRITE_BUF_LEN

Algo:

- RSR_TOP < W_cubic logic: RSR_TOP = rtt*spd*K || W_cubic ???
- R_MODE new algo: if no losses detected on HEAD(W_cubic >> RSR_TOP*2 ?), set send_q_limit = RSR_TOP on ALL chans until agag ==0; then add period == rtt after setting send_q_limit = rsr and before starting to increment agag!
    along with push algo, this will ensure that at least in R_MODE we will get 100% max_chan detection
+ Detect HEAD wrong markers: Ch < 50 && Cs=max_ACS*100/ACS < 50: if min_Ch_chan == min_Cs_chan: max_chan=min_Ch_chan

Q:

- Why still no packets to send (not pushed to RSR_TOP on HEAD even in 1 ch?)
